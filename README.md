## Introduction

Seblak is an Indonesian specialty food that has gained significant popularity, especially among young people. In today's digital era, many seblak products are marketed through various e-commerce platforms, including Tokopedia. To gain deeper insights into trends, popularity, and the quality of seblak products sold on Tokopedia, comprehensive data analysis is conducted using web scraping techniques.

Web scraping is a method of automatically extracting data from websites, enabling us to gather extensive and detailed information quickly and efficiently. With web scraping, we can collect various important data such as prices, ratings, customer reviews, and product descriptions. This information is then analyzed to obtain valuable insights into consumer preferences, product quality, and effective marketing strategies.

In this analysis, I will use web scraping techniques to gather data on seblak products sold on Tokopedia. The collected data will cover various aspects such as product variations, prices, popularity, and customer reviews. This analysis aims to provide a clear overview of the seblak market trends on Tokopedia and assist sellers in enhancing their product quality and marketing strategies. Through this analysis, I also aim to offer useful insights for consumers in selecting the best seblak products on Tokopedia.

They consider running a dropshipping scheme from a website called Tokopedia. Initially unsure, they recall, "Selling seblak seems quite appealing." Based on this thought, they decide to analyze the sales of seblak on Tokopedia. Are many people fond of seblak? Are there many buyers of seblak?

Through this analysis, they hope to gain a clear understanding of the interest and sales volume of seblak on Tokopedia, enabling them to make more informed decisions about starting their seblak dropshipping business.

## Conclusion
 
Based on the data analysis conducted, here are some recommendations:

1. As discussed in interpretation #11, selling seblak at a price point that ensures maximum profit is challenging, especially when competing with established competitors like Kylafood. Therefore, I recommend selling seblak in the price range of Rp 5000 to Rp 10000. This price range is more competitive and aligns with consumer preferences, as discussed in interpretation #13, where higher prices tend to deter customers. Given the limited budget for production but enough for promotion, this price range should help manage costs effectively.

2. Building on the first point, aiming to prepare a budget for up to 100 units of seblak within the chosen price range is prudent. Based on sales data, selling up to 100 units of one type of seblak minimizes risk and allows for manageable inventory management.

3. Considering the differing production costs between Jabodetabek (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi) and non-Jabodetabek areas, it's crucial to target the right market. Additionally, logistics costs should be factored inâ€”selling locally within Jabodetabek allows for slightly higher prices (up to Rp 10000) despite shipping costs, whereas selling outside this area might necessitate lower product prices to remain competitive after factoring in shipping costs. Understanding these regional dynamics will optimize pricing strategy.

4. The presence of outliers in sales volume indicates sporadic spikes possibly due to viral trends. Sellers should monitor market conditions to gauge the longevity of seblak's popularity. Additionally, outliers in product pricing should be considered carefully. It's recommended to assess profitability over three months, then review pricing and product strategy based on market trends.

5. Regarding product ratings, while consumer ratings generally tend to be positive for seblak products, it's essential to focus on selling popular types of seblak. However, since ratings are generally favorable across the board, prioritize product variety and customer satisfaction to maintain positive feedback and repeat customers.

These recommendations aim to guide effective decision-making in starting a seblak dropshipping business on Tokopedia, leveraging market insights and consumer behavior data.
